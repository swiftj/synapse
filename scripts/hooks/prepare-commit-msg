# No-op. Version bumping is handled by post-commit via amend,
# since pre-commit can't read the message and prepare-commit-msg
# can't stage files into the current commit.
#
# Install: Run ./scripts/install-hooks.sh
# Location: scripts/hooks/prepare-commit-msg

# Clean up any stale files from old hook versions
